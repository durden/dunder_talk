# Python Philosophy

- When in doubt, rationalize from 'The Zen'
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Readability counts.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

# Presenter Notes

- no ambiguity, getlen(), getLength(), len(), etc.
- Much cleaner IMO than c++/Java syntax of operator overloading
- Docs aren't great, but clearly defined what happens
- Use caution
